/*
 *  this offset learning algorithm is inspired by this paper from Bill Premerlani
 *  and rewritten as an example for Eigen by Daniel Frenzel
 *
 *  http://gentlenav.googlecode.com/files/MagnetometerOffsetNullingRevisited.pdf
 *
 *  The base algorithm works well, but is quite sensitive to
 *  noise. After long discussions with Bill, the following changes were
 *  made:
 *
 *   1) we keep a history buffer that effectively divides the mag
 *      vectors into a set of N streams. The algorithm is run on the
 *      streams separately
 *
 *   2) within each stream we only calculate a change when the mag
 *      vector has changed by a significant amount.
 *
 *  This gives us the property that we learn quickly if there is no
 *  noise, but still learn correctly (and slowly) in the face of lots of
 *  noise.
